Hello , good morning !

this is a maze made with HTML , CSS and JAVASCRIPT (IN DEVELOPMENT)

for now , this only works whit keyboards events like UP , DOWN , LEFT and RIGHT and the player can only move through the maze, and may bump into walls.

soon I will make it responsive and create functions to work on mobile devices.

thanks to acess my code
